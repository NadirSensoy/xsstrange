## Getting Started

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/xsstrange.git
   cd xsstrange
   ```

### Development Environment

You can use either:
- The project's Docker environment
- A local Python setup with Flask

For Docker setup:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

For local setup:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Creating XSS Test Cases

### Test Case Structure

XSStrange focuses on two main types of XSS vulnerabilities:
- Reflected XSS
- DOM-based XSS

Each test case should:
- Demonstrate a single XSS vulnerability concept
- Be clear and educational
- Include proper documentation and risk assessment

### Using the Template

1. Locate the base template:
   ```
   xsstrange/templates/case_form.html
   ```

2. Copy the template to the appropriate category folder:
   ```
   cases/<category>/<your_test_case>.html
   ```
   Categories include: reflected_xss, dom_xss, etc.

3. Edit only the commented sections in the template:
   ```html
   <!-- Case Information Section -->
   <!-- Only modify content between comment tags -->
   ```

4. Required sections in each test case:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Risk Level
   - Category
   - Difficulty
   - Implementation Details

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting your test case:

1. Test with a local server:
   - Use VS Code Live Server extension, or
   - XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP

2. Verify the vulnerability works as expected
3. Ensure proper error handling
4. Check for unintended side effects

## Contribution Workflow

### Branch Creation

Create a new branch for your changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/new_xss_case
```

### Making Changes

1. Create your test case following the template
2. Add necessary documentation
3. Test thoroughly
4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git add cases/<category>/<your_test_case>.html
   git commit -m "Add new XSS case: Brief description"
   ```

### Submitting Changes

1. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new_xss_case
   ```

2. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to the original repository
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your branch
   - Provide a clear description of your test case

## Review Process

After submitting your Pull Request:
1. Maintainers will review your test case
2. They may request changes or clarification
3. Once approved, your contribution will be merged

## Questions and Support

If you have questions or need help:
- Open an issue for general questions
- Contact the maintainers for specific concerns
